# Cryptocactus

![Cryptocactus logo](/frontend/src/assets/logo.png)

Cryptocactus is a decentralized application that enables users to mint unique NFTs representing their plants on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFTs can be traded on marketplaces like OpenSea and will forever be a unique representation of the user's plant.

## Authentication

To use Cryptocactus, you need to connect to Metamask, a popular Ethereum wallet that enables users to interact with dApps like Cryptocactus.

## Usage

1. Click on "Upload Plant" button
2. Choose whether to upload or update a plant
3. Fill out the required information and upload an image of your plant
4. Your plant will be minted as an NFT and will be available to view on OpenSea

## Technologies

Cryptocactus is built with Vue.js and Vuetify for the front-end, and uses the NFT.Storage API for image and metadata storage. The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and was written in Solidity.
